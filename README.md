Hello world og, first time working in github let's learn boys
Currently learn Html and Css fundamentals, but I don't plan on stopping there, I also need to learn python which will eventually lead to Java. I've also heard some things about ruby that have piqued my interest so really I just trying to absorb as much information as possible and do stuff with it :)
